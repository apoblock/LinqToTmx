# LINQ to TMX
Easy to use library to use Translation Memory eXchange (.tmx) files with LINQ queries

## What can it be used for?
TMX files can be used to keep translation data in a format known by many translation 
companies and without strong ties to the .net framework. This means that a single 
repository of tmx files could be used by a project with both .net and open source 
components.
	e.g. .Net WPF application with Java Web Services
